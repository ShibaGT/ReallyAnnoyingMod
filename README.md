# ReallyAnnoyingMod
This Gorilla Tag mod spams sounds every frame that your in a server, i recommend turning this off before you go into a game, unless your doing a challenge, well if you are, then make sure to turn down your volume lol, the volume on the sounds are 0.25 or smth so its not deafening but still
